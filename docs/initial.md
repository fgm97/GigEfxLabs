# Documentation: Not in use - GigEfx Project Pages (Now in `N.I.S/` Folder)

These pages were part of the earlier phase of GigEfx Labs’ web architecture and branding direction. Each was designed to showcase a specific project or serve as a thematic homepage. The following describes their content and intended structure before being consolidated into the main GigEfxLabs experience.

## Final Notes:
These pages have been retired and moved to a folder labeled `N.I.S` — **Not In Scope** — as the project direction shifted toward a consolidated and centralized experience within `GigEfxLabs.html`.

The N.I.S. archive remains valuable for reference, reuse of components, documentation and educational purposes.
