# Consolidating External Project Links into the `GigEfxLabs` Page

## Objective
The goal is to create a more seamless and centralized user experience. All previous project pages were separate with their own style and structure and was then consolidated into the `GigEfxLabs.html` page. The user can now access the information for each project in its respective section through animated, expandable cards without redirecting them to another page.

## Why This Change Was Made

| Original | Updated |
|----------|---------|
| Each project had its own external HTML file, requiring full page reloads. | All project content is now presented in expandable cards on the `GigEfxLabs.html` page. |
| Navigation was less fluid and required multiple page transitions.         | Users can view all project information in one scrollable, interactive view.             |
| Redundant styling and scripts across multiple files.                      | Reuse of shared CSS and JS, reducing load time and maintenance.                         |

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Update the HTML Structure**
All project sections were added to the `#projects` section of `GigEfxLabs.html` using this structure:

```html
<div class="card project-toggle project-theme-[project-name]">
  <div class="project-header toggle-header">...</div>
  <div class="toggle-content project-body">...</div>
</div>
```

### 2. **Add Unique Content per Project**
Each card includes:
- A `caption`
- An `overview`, `features`, and `value statement`
- Visual `badges` for themes (e.g., AI, Finance, Deals)

### 3. **Use JavaScript to Enable Dropdown Behavior**
```js
document.querySelectorAll('.project-toggle').forEach(card => {
  const header = card.querySelector('.toggle-header');
  header.addEventListener('click', () => {
    card.classList.toggle('active');
  });
});
```

### 4. **Apply Dynamic Styling via CSS**
Each card theme (e.g., `project-theme-bounceback`) has:
- Unique border/accent colors
- Caption styling
- Hover effects and animations
- Expandable content with `max-height` transition

### 5. **Update Navigation Links**
Old links like:
```html
<a href="SmartCart.html">SmartCart</a>
```
Were replaced with:
```html
<a href="#projects">Projects</a>
```
