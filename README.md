## External Assets

- `logo.png`: Company logo displayed in header.
- Fonts: Uses system fonts (`Segoe UI`, `Tahoma`) for universal compatibility.
- Email submission: Uses `mailto:` without backend logic.

## Not In Scope

The `subscribe.html` file and associated features were later extracted and relocated to a folder named **`N.I.S` (Not In Scope)**. This preserves modularity and prevents overloading the landing page, while keeping the feature accessible.
